# GoodTube

This extension aims to bring back the old YouTube layout.
Not just the one from 2016, but also old layouts from 2012-2015.

# Reminder

This project is in VERY early stages.
Attempting to go to any normal YouTube page will result in a blank page with the
old layout's pageframe.

However there are some debug pages.


[2016 Watch Test](https://www.youtube.com/gt/debug/2016/watchtest?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) (Pretty much an abandoned page. It uses an iframe of polymer and you have to manually execute a script to get the info on the old layout. Also doesn't even work half the time lmfao)


[2013 Player Test](https://www.youtube.com/gt/debug/2013/playertest) Test of the 2013 player. Broken.

(update: the 2016 watchtest doesn't even load lmfao)

# Why it's Good

We're not just restyling the current layout to look like the old one.
That's what others do. This is an entire local recreation of it.
However...
