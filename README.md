# This version of GoodTube is no longer in development.

I am going to archive the repository, as the WebExtension version of GoodTube is no longer in development.
One of my friends is most likely going to take over development and make it into a standalone Python proxy application.
You can join the Discord listed below to see when and if the new version becomes a thing.

If you want to continue work on this WebExtension version of GoodTube, feel free to fork this repo.

Project to bring back the old YouTube layout.
Works by recreating the page locally and making it work with the modern YouTubeI API.
